# Trixibelle’s Coding Portfolio

## Hi, I’m Trixibelle 👋
I’m a fourth-year Design major at UC Davis with a focus on graphic design, product design, and front-end development.

For each coding project in this repository, I created all visual graphics using my digital drawing skills. I designed the layouts and wireframes in Figma before translating them into code. All projects are built using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on clean structure, responsive layouts, and design-driven user experiences.

## Design Approach
This project was designed to evoke a sense of nostalgia while introducing a subtle futuristic aesthetic. I intentionally balanced familiar visual elements with modern layouts to create an experience that feels both reflective and forward-looking.

User experience guided each coding decision, with careful attention to functionality, pacing, and visual hierarchy. Each element was designed with intention to prevent user fatigue while maintaining engagement through purposeful interaction.
